### Review
Andrew Ng has an incredible ability of articulating heavily technical lectures in a simple and understandable manner, which I believe could not be achieved without deep expertise in neural networks. I feel extremely privileged to learn from Coursera's co-founder himself, if only he was my lecturer in university!  

While the course materials were very in-depth with multiple real-life application examples, they were well organised and quite easy to follow.The first 3 felt like a setup of fundamental skills for the last 2 courses which were especially loaded with programming assignments that required significantly more time to work through. I had fun completing a variety of projects including synthetic name and music generation, facial and object recognition and natural language processing, many of which were truly eye-opening.
